@Elhorst.2014 provides a comprehensive introduction to spatial panel data methods. Article length introduction to spatial panel data models (FE and RE) can be found in @Elhorst.2012, @Millo.2012 and @Croissant.2018. @LeSage.2014b discusses Bayesian panel data methods.

Note that we will only discuss some basics here, as the complete econometrics of these models and their estimation strategy become insanely complicated [@Lee.2010].

## Static panel data models

The idea behind a static panel data with auto-regressive term is similar to the cross sectional situation [@Millo.2012].


$$
		{\bm y}= +\rho(\bm I_T\otimes {\bm W_N}){\bm y}+{\bm X}{\bm \beta}+ {\bm u}.
$$	

where $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product (block-wise multiplication).

$$
\begin{split}
\underbrace{\underbrace{\bm I_T}_{T \times T} \otimes \underbrace{\bm W_N}_{N \times N}}_{NT \times NT}=
\begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 & \cdots & 0  \\
      0 & 1 & \cdots & 0  \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
v_{1} w_{1} & v_{1} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{1} w_{m} \\
v_{2} w_{1} & v_{2} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{2} w_{m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
v_{n} w_{1} & v_{n} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{n} w_{m}
\end{array}\right] =\\
\begin{pmatrix}
      \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
v_{1} w_{1} & v_{1} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{1} w_{m} \\
v_{2} w_{1} & v_{2} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{2} w_{m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
v_{n} w_{1} & v_{n} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{n} w_{m}
\end{array}\right] & 0 & \cdots & 0  \\
      0 & \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
v_{1} w_{1} & v_{1} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{1} w_{m} \\
v_{2} w_{1} & v_{2} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{2} w_{m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
v_{n} w_{1} & v_{n} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{n} w_{m}
\end{array}\right] & \cdots & 0  \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & \cdots & \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
v_{1} w_{1} & v_{1} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{1} w_{m} \\
v_{2} w_{1} & v_{2} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{2} w_{m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
v_{n} w_{1} & v_{n} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{n} w_{m}
\end{array}\right]
\end{pmatrix}
\end{split}
$$

Here we model only spatial dependence within each cross-section and multiply the same spatial weights matrix $T$ times. Off block-diagonal elements are all zero. So there is no spatial dependence that goes across time.

The error term can be decomposed into two parts:

$$
		{\bm u}= (\bm \iota_T \otimes {\bm I_N})\bm \mu+ {\bm \nu},
$$

where $\bm \iota_T$ is a $T \times 1$ vector of ones, ${\bm I_N}$ an $N \times N$ identity matrix, $\bm \mu$ is a vector of time-invariant individual specific effects (not spatially autocorrelated).

We could obviously extent the specification to allow for error correlation by specifying

$$
		{\bm \nu}= \lambda(\bm I_T \otimes {\bm W_N})\bm \nu + {\bm \varepsilon}.
$$

The individual effects can be treated as fixed or random.

__Fixed Effects__

In the FE model, the individual specific effects are treated as fixed. If we re-write the equation above, we derive at the well-know fixed effects formula with an additional spatial autoregressive term: 

$$
		{y_{it}}= \rho\sum_{j=1}^Nw_{ij}y_{jt} + \bm x_{it}\bm\beta + \mu_i + \nu_{it},
$$
where $\mu_i$ denote the individual-specific fixed effects.

As with the standard spatial lag model, we cannot rely on the OLS estimator because of the simultaneity problem. The coefficients are thus estimated by maximum likelihood [@Elhorst.2014].

__Random Effects__

In the RE model, the individual specific effects are treated as components of the error $\mu \sim \mathrm{IID}(o, \sigma_\mu^2)$. The model can then be written as

$$
\begin{split}
		{\bm y}= +\rho(\bm I_T\otimes {\bm W_N}){\bm y}+{\bm X}{\bm \beta}+ {\bm u}, \\
		{\bm u}= (\bm \iota_T \otimes {\bm I_N})\bm \mu+ [\bm I_T \otimes (\bm I_N -  \lambda{\bm W_N})]^{-1} {\bm \varepsilon}.
\end{split}		
$$	

As with the conventional random effects model, we make the strong assumption that the unobserved individual
effects are uncorrelated with the covariates $\bm X$ in the model.
